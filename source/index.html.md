# Introduction

Welcome to the Ancestors mod!

This mod is developed to write an AAR: Ancestors. I decided release it for any 
person who wants enjoy it. The mod features two new societies, two main inheritable 
traits, two main characters and a ton of new flavour events.

# Main characters

## Khalga

The original twin brother of <a href="#Vee">Vee</a>. He appears in an event at few 
days after game start.

Khalga grows to become a lover of adventures and women, a nomad who reaches 
the most remote corners of the world. The reasons why he does it you have to discover them.

Khalga has "soft immortality". This means that he can not die of old age, but he 
is not immune to a powerful illness or a violent death. You can not get rid of him 
throughout the game: Even if you manage to kill him, his essence migrates to another 
container, making him reborn with his basic attributes.



# Sakya Society



# Pentaghast Society
