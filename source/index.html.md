# Introduction

Welcome to the Ancestors mod!

This mod is developed to write an AAR: Ancestors. I decided release it for any 
person who wants enjoy it. The mod features two new societies, two main inheritable 
traits, two main characters and a ton of new flavour events.

<aside class="warning">Since it's the documentation for the mod, possible spoilers can appear. Be careful if you want to discover the story by your own.</aside>

# Main characters

## Khalga

```yaml
event: ACS.7
```

The original twin brother of <a href="#vee">Vee</a>. He appears in an event at few days after game start.

```yaml
event: [ACS.9, ACS.18, ACS.10]
```

Khalga is kidnapped by a member of Sakya society 15 days after his birth and transported to Sakya leader court. Here, He raises until his adulthood.

Khalga grows to become a lover of adventures and women, a nomad who reaches the most remote corners of the world. He leaves the court of Sakya society leader and travels by the world selecting a random province once a year.

```yaml
event: ACS.16
```

Khalga has "soft immortality". This means that he can not die of old age, but he is not immune to a powerful illness or a violent death. You can not get rid of him throughout the game: Even if you manage to kill him, his essence migrates to another container, making him reborn with his basic attributes.

## Vee

> Born at

```yaml
event: ACS.7
```

The twin sister of <a href="#khalga">Khalga</a>, Vee raises to become the most 
beautiful woman in the world. She and her indirect actions lead most of the mod's 
narrative. As if she were the reincarnation of Helena, no one is immune to her charms, 
powerfully influencing all the characters in your match.

Keeping Vee in your court allows to you some special buffs:

- +1 monthly prestige. Become the envy of other sovereigns by having the most beautiful woman in the world serving in your court.
- New casus belli: Having the most beautiful woman in the world in your court also has its risks. When she reaches adulthood, any landed character can declare war to you. If you lose, Vee will leave your court and you will lose prestige.
