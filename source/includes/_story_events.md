## The comet

At the game start, a comet appears in the sky. 30 days after, many comet fragments
will fall on random provinces. The character province will be excluded. 

Every character in province will die and province itself will have a modifier
that reduces levy, increases building construction time and revolt risk.

## Senua, Olaf and Tilda

15 days after the comet impact, three story characters spawns at player location. Tilda goes to a mercenary band immediately, but
Senua and Olaf rests in character court. Senua give birth to Vee and Khalga after a few days, then Olaf goes to 
a mercenary band. He takes the control of it immediately.
