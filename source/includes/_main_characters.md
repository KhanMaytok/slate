# Main characters

## Khalga

> Born at

```yaml
event: ACS.7
```

The original twin brother of <a href="#vee">Vee</a>. He appears in an event at few 
days after game start.

Khalga is kidnapped by a member of Sakya society 15 days after his birth and transported to Sakya leader court

```yaml
event: ["ACS.9", "ACS.18", "ACS.10"]
```

Khalga grows to become a lover of adventures and women, a nomad who reaches 
the most remote corners of the world. The reasons why he does it you have to discover them.

Khalga has "soft immortality". This means that he can not die of old age, but he 
is not immune to a powerful illness or a violent death. You can not get rid of him 
throughout the game: Even if you manage to kill him, his essence migrates to another 
container, making him reborn with his basic attributes.

```yaml
event: ACS.16
```

## Vee

> Born at

```yaml
event: ACS.7
```

The twin sister of <a href="#khalga">Khalga</a>, Vee raises to become the most 
beautiful woman in the world. She and her indirect actions lead most of the mod's 
narrative. As if she were the reincarnation of Helena, no one is immune to her charms, 
powerfully influencing all the characters in your match.

Keeping Vee in your court allows to you some special buffs:

- +1 monthly prestige. Become the envy of other sovereigns by having the most beautiful woman in the world serving in your court.
- New casus belli: Having the most beautiful woman in the world in your court also has its risks. When she reaches adulthood, any landed character can declare war to you. If you lose, Vee will leave your court and you will lose prestige.
